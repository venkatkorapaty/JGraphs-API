# JGraphs-API
An in-progress Graph Theory API being developed in Java.

It will contain multiple different graph types (weighted, directed, complete, bipartite, etc)
and will eventually support different functionality and graph algorithms such as Bellman-Ford's single source shortest path, or checking if two graphs are isomorphic.
At the end, I hope to implement an abstract factory method design pattern to put all the graphs behind
an interface.
